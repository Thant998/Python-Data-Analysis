# Background

The sales data was collected over a period of one year and includes information on customer demographics, product categories, purchase amounts, and dates. The goal of the project is to analyze this data and identify patterns and trends that can be used to improve the company's sales and marketing strategies.

# Data Sources

The data was collected using the company's point-of-sale system and is stored in a CSV file. Before analysis, we cleaned and transformed the data to ensure consistency and accuracy.

# Methods

We used a combination of descriptive statistics, data visualization, and machine learning techniques to analyze the sales data. Specifically, we used Pandas to manipulate and clean the data, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations, and Scikit-Learn for machine learning models.

# Usage

To run the analysis, clone the repository and run the sales_analysis.ipynb notebook in Jupyter. The notebook contains the code used for data cleaning, visualization, and machine learning models.

# Dependencies

The project requires Python 3.x and the following libraries:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
You can install these dependencies using pip by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
